# Predicting March Madness 2018
We plan on creating a machine learning program in order to simulate college basketball March Madness results for 2018. It can be used for bets on different games or even for building your own bracket in a chance to win the big moneyzzzz $$$$$$$ 

# Abstract
Use a kaggle dataset containing tournament and regular season data alongside seedings and other variables to obtain potential standings in the 2018 March Madness tournament. Experiment with different classifiers and different types of data to produce the best machine learning algorithm to best reach our goal. 

# Timeline
## Week 3
Figure out how to import data via pandas or other relate data packages found in python

## Week 4
Learn how to use SKLearn and different classifiers, also think about its applications in our project

## Week 5
Continue to get adept with SKLearn and also starting thinking about potential use in project

## Week 6
Begin coding using our chosen classifiers 

## Week 7
Code until finished, debug errors, finalize product

## Week 8

## Week 9

## Week 10
Hopefully finish. If we finished earlier, we could also pick up another sport related data set do more with the predictions, such as comparing tournaments. WIP 

# Data Sources
Kaggle

# Technologies
Python (Pandas, SKLearn) for algorithm and loading/ manipulating data

# Club Resources needed
Free Food? :D and maybe more members who want to learn or know machine learning.
